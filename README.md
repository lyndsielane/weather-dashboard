## Weather Dashboard

* Upon opening the Weather Dashboard, the user is presented with a simple  header title and a side column to search for a city. 
* Upon entering a city name into the search bar and hitting the search button, the data connected to that city pulls from the Open Weather API in a convenient format for the user. 
* The top right displays gives current conditions for the selected city including the current condition, temperature, wind, humidity, and UVI.
* Beneath the current conditions display is a 5-day forecast displayed in separate cards to show the predicted condition, temperature, wind, and humidity.
* All past searched cities display beneath the search bar for convenience to pull the weather again at a later time.
